  Hi, my name is Sima and I'm a Senior Staff AI Scientist at SamsungSDS AI Science Lab in San Jose CA. Prior to Samsung, I worked as a Data Scientist, and Probabilistic Engineer for Applied Materials and GE Global Research.
  My background is in Bayesian Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Genrative AI. I received my PhD from Georgia Institute of Technology on Topology Optmization for Computer-Aided-Enginerring (CEA) of porous compsite microsrtuctures under supervision of Professor Tequila Harris.

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
