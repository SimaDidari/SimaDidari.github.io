  Hi, my name is Sima and I'm a Senior Staff AI Scientist at Samsung SDS AI Science Lab in San Jose CA. 
  Prior to Samsung, I worked as a Data Scientist, and Probabilistic Engineer for Applied Materials and GE Global Research.
  My background is in Bayesian Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI. 
  I received my PhD from Georgia Institute of Technology on Topology Optimization for Computer-Aided-Design (CAE) of microstructures under the supervision of Professor Tequila Harris.

          We defined a novel Uncertainty-aware Reward Model (URM) for the preference training of LLMs.
          The URM proxy quantifies the uncertainty of paired responses based on Bayesian approximation.
          Incorporating the proposed proxy into language model training boosts the instruction
          following capability of language models by refining data curation for training 
           and improving policy optimization objectives, 
          thereby surpassing existing methods by a large margin on benchmarks such as
            Vicuna and MT-bench.
