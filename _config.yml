  Hi, my name is Sima and I'm a Senior Staff AI Scientist at Samsung SDS AI Science Lab in San Jose CA. 
  Prior to Samsung, I worked as a Data Scientist, and Probabilistic Engineer for Applied Materials and GE Global Research.
  My background is in Bayesian Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI. 
  I received my PhD from Georgia Institute of Technology on Topology Optimization for Computer-Aided-Design (CAE) of microstructures under the supervision of Professor Tequila Harris.

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio.
          If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
