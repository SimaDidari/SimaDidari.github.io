  Hi, my name is Sima and I'm a Senior Staff AI Scientist at Samsung SDS AI Science Lab in San Jose CA. 
  Prior to Samsung, I worked as a Data Scientist, and Probabilistic Engineer for Applied Materials and GE Global Research.
  My background is in Bayesian Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Generative AI. 
  I received my PhD from Georgia Institute of Technology on Topology Optimization
   for Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) of microstructures under the supervision 
   of Professor Tequila Harris.

          We defined a novel Uncertainty-aware Reward Model (URM) for the preference training of LLMs 
          based on Bayesian approximation to quantify the uncertainty of paired responses.
          We experimentally demonstrated that using URM in LLMs training boosts their instruction
          following capability and their policy optimization objectives. 
          The URM based finetuning surpasses existing methods by a large margin on benchmarks such as
            Vicuna and MT-bench.
